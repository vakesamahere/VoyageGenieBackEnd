Now I want to repeat the benchmark with added system prompt (for LLaMa-3 70B this significantly improved the result), but this would probably take 2-3 days. Also hopefully LLaMa-3 400B will be released soon and we will witness an interesting heavyweight fight between the two.

Post Title: 'My experience running the massive WizardLM2 8x22b (141b) on the cheapest current Threadripper CPU + a 4090 + 64Gb DDR5 RDIMM '
                    User: Porespellar
                    Subreddit: r/LocalLLaMA:
                    Text body: TL:DR - I built an inference server / VR gaming PC using the cheapest current Threadripper CPU + RTX 4090 + the fastest DDR5 RAM and M2 drive I could find. Loaded up a huge 141b parameter model that I knew would max it out. Token speed was way better than I expected and is totally tolerable. Biggest regret is not buying more RAM. 

I just finished building a purpose-built home lab inference server and wanted to share my experience and test results with my favorite Reddit community. 

I’ve been futzing around for the past year running AI models on an old VR gaming / mining rig (5yr pld intel i7 + 3070 + 32 GB of DDR4) and yeah, it could run 8b models ok, but other than that, it was pretty bad at running anything else. 

I finally decided to build a proper inference server that will also double as a VR rig because I can’t in good conscience let a 4090 sit in a PC and not game on it at least occasionally. 

I was originally going to go with the Mac Studio with 192GB of RAM route but decided against it because I know as soon as I bought it they would release the M4 model and I would have buyer’s remorse for years to come. 

I also considered doing an AMD EPYC CPU build to get close to the memory bandwidth of the Mac Studio but decided against it because there is literally only one or two ATX EPYC motherboards available because EPYCs are made for servers. I didn’t want a rack mount setup or a mobo that didn’t even have an audio chip or other basic quality of life features. 

So here’s the inference server I ended up building:
- Gigabyte AERO D TRX50 revision 1.2 Motherboard
- AMD 7960X Threadripper CPU
- Noctua NH-U14S TR5-SP6 CPU Cooler
- 64GB Kingston Fury Renegade Pro 6400 DDR5 RDIMMS (4 x 16GB) RAM
- 2 TB Crucial T700 M.2 NVME Gen 5 @ 12,400 Mb/s
- Seasonic TX 1300W Power Supply 
- Gigabyte AERO RTX 4090 GPU
- Fractal Torrent Case (with 2 180mm front fans and 3 140mm bottom fans)

For software and config I’m running:
- Win11 Pro with Ollama and Docker + Open WebUI + Apache Tika (for pre-RAG document parsing). 
- AMD Expo OC @6400 profile for memory speed 
- Resizable BAR feature turned on in BIOS to help with LLM RAM offloading once VRAM fills up
- Nvidia Studio Drivers up-to-date

I knew that the WizardLM2 8x22b (141b) model was a beast and would fill up VRAM, bleed into system RAM, and then likely overflow into M.2 disk storage after its context window was taken into account. I watched it do all of this in resource monitor and HWinfo. 

Amazingly, when I ran a few test prompts on the huge 141 billion parameter WizardLM2 8x22b, I was getting slow (6 tokens per second) but completely coherent and usable responses. I honestly can’t believe that it could run this model AT ALL without crashing the system. 

To test the inference speed of my Threadripper build, I tested a variety of models using Llama-bench. Here are the results. Note: tokens per second in the results are an average from 2 standard Llama-bench prompts (assume Q4 GGUFs unless otherwise stated in the model name)

- llama3: 8b-instruct-Fp16 = 50.49 t/s avg
- llama3: 70b-instruct = 4.72 t/s avg 
- command-r: 35b-v0.1-q4 K M = 18.69 t/s avg
- 1lava: 34b-v1.6-q4 K_M = 35.12 t/s avg 
- gwen2:72b = 4.56 t/s avg
- wizardin2: 8x226 (141b) = 6.01 t/s

My biggest regret is not buying more RAM so that I could run models at larger context windows for RAG. 

Any and all feedback or questions are welcome.

\*Notes my screen capturing will not let me use my micrphone, so I am typing, but you can use Whisper alongside everything else.  Also, the audio is crummy because its just the sound from my speakers recorded in the microphone.  If the response from the model is not too long the final TTS reply is almost as fast as talking to a person (see end of video for fast reply).

I've been interested in getting the most out of a single GPU card, the video has everything running on a single 4090.

Textgen Webui: [https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) (video is using v1.9.1 but there are even more recent versions)

text-generation-webui-model\_ducking Extension: [https://github.com/BoredBrownBear/text-generation-webui-model\_ducking](https://github.com/BoredBrownBear/text-generation-webui-model_ducking) This is a large part of the solution, it unloads your llm from vram when not inferencing with it, so the SDXL and phivision models can load in their place

SDXL: using the send\_api\_pictures extension that comes with textgen, altered to unload and load the model only when in use (If there is interest I can try documenting this)

Vision Model: [https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid\_Vision](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision) (I made this extension FYSA) This lets you load a variety of different vision models and will auto load and unload them without needing to alter anything.

STT: using the Whisper\_STT extension that comes with textgen, using the small.en model

TTS: using the Alltalk\_tts extension for oobabooga's textgen webui [https://github.com/erew123/alltalk\_tts](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts) I have deepspeed enabled (there are prebuilt wheels for windows that work well), this is why the responses are so quick.

  
The order of loading the extensions is important this is my CMD\_FLAG:

If there is interest in this and I'm not beating a dead horse (like this is a common setup) I can document the changes to the code and exactly how I'm pulling this off.

Created a repo with beam search modification. I've not evaluated yet, but from my experience it produce better answers than default sampler in tasks like story generation and sometimes reasoning. Sampler needs X \* num\_beams computational time

Implementation works with KV cache but may be not optimal and transformers inference relatively slow compare with other backends.  
If you know some good datasets to estimate ability producing long answers I would be glad to see

                    Subreddit: r/LocalLLaMA:
                    Text body: I'm using more and more different things which take up VRAM: LLMs (multiple models for different tasks), STT and TTS models, embeddings, vision models, stable diffusion etc.

For personal use, it would be silly and expensive to have them all loaded up into VRAM as you'd need tons of GPUs to hold everything. So you're left with dynamic loading and unloading. 

The question then turns to how to quickly unload and load models to switch between different uses assuming:

1. There's an efficient router which manages requests and queues/batches them intelligently with some degree of hystersis to balance latency with switching costs
2. That all models are stored in main memory so there are no slow disk loads.

Now normally I use vLLM to serve LLMs, but it seems to be very slow at loading up models. For Llama 8 FP16 it takes 8s to be ready from a warm cache. Qwen 14 takes 11s with a warm cache. Way too slow.

I think llama.cpp is quicker and on testing Llama 8, I get around 2s load time, but DeepSeek Coder v2 Lite Q8 still took 13 seconds to load.

What's taking so long for these models to be initialized and how can it be speeded up?

As I and many of you have noticed, P40s have become really expensive. Are there any cards with similar amounts of VRAM that don't cost an arm and a leg?

The ones I know of off the top of my head are:
- P100: 16gb of VRAM, actually usable fp16 perf, but has power state issues and also isn't nearly as usable with llama.cpp as the P40 (Can anyone confirm this, I can't remember where I heard this from)
- 2080ti 22gb: A decent deal for 22gb of vram but still pretty expensive
- M40: 24gb of VRAM but apparently sucks for anything ML related. Could it even potentially be used to get usable speeds or is Maxwell too out of date?

Post Title: 'My experience running the massive WizardLM2 8x22b (141b) on the cheapest current Threadripper CPU + a 4090 + 64Gb DDR5 RDIMM '
                    User: Porespellar
                    Subreddit: r/LocalLLaMA:
                    Text body: TL:DR - I built an inference server / VR gaming PC using the cheapest current Threadripper CPU + RTX 4090 + the fastest DDR5 RAM and M2 drive I could find. Loaded up a huge 141b parameter model that I knew would max it out. Token speed was way better than I expected and is totally tolerable. Biggest regret is not buying more RAM. 

I just finished building a purpose-built home lab inference server and wanted to share my experience and test results with my favorite Reddit community. 

I’ve been futzing around for the past year running AI models on an old VR gaming / mining rig (5yr pld intel i7 + 3070 + 32 GB of DDR4) and yeah, it could run 8b models ok, but other than that, it was pretty bad at running anything else. 

I finally decided to build a proper inference server that will also double as a VR rig because I can’t in good conscience let a 4090 sit in a PC and not game on it at least occasionally. 

I was originally going to go with the Mac Studio with 192GB of RAM route but decided against it because I know as soon as I bought it they would release the M4 model and I would have buyer’s remorse for years to come. 

I also considered doing an AMD EPYC CPU build to get close to the memory bandwidth of the Mac Studio but decided against it because there is literally only one or two ATX EPYC motherboards available because EPYCs are made for servers. I didn’t want a rack mount setup or a mobo that didn’t even have an audio chip or other basic quality of life features. 

So here’s the inference server I ended up building:
- Gigabyte AERO D TRX50 revision 1.2 Motherboard
- AMD 7960X Threadripper CPU
- Noctua NH-U14S TR5-SP6 CPU Cooler
- 64GB Kingston Fury Renegade Pro 6400 DDR5 RDIMMS (4 x 16GB) RAM
- 2 TB Crucial T700 M.2 NVME Gen 5 @ 12,400 Mb/s
- Seasonic TX 1300W Power Supply 
- Gigabyte AERO RTX 4090 GPU
- Fractal Torrent Case (with 2 180mm front fans and 3 140mm bottom fans)

For software and config I’m running:
- Win11 Pro with Ollama and Docker + Open WebUI + Apache Tika (for pre-RAG document parsing). 
- AMD Expo OC @6400 profile for memory speed 
- Resizable BAR feature turned on in BIOS to help with LLM RAM offloading once VRAM fills up
- Nvidia Studio Drivers up-to-date

I knew that the WizardLM2 8x22b (141b) model was a beast and would fill up VRAM, bleed into system RAM, and then likely overflow into M.2 disk storage after its context window was taken into account. I watched it do all of this in resource monitor and HWinfo. 

Amazingly, when I ran a few test prompts on the huge 141 billion parameter WizardLM2 8x22b, I was getting slow (6 tokens per second) but completely coherent and usable responses. I honestly can’t believe that it could run this model AT ALL without crashing the system. 

To test the inference speed of my Threadripper build, I tested a variety of models using Llama-bench. Here are the results. Note: tokens per second in the results are an average from 2 standard Llama-bench prompts (assume Q4 GGUFs unless otherwise stated in the model name)

- llama3: 8b-instruct-Fp16 = 50.49 t/s avg
- llama3: 70b-instruct = 4.72 t/s avg 
- command-r: 35b-v0.1-q4 K M = 18.69 t/s avg
- 1lava: 34b-v1.6-q4 K_M = 35.12 t/s avg 
- gwen2:72b = 4.56 t/s avg
- wizardin2: 8x226 (141b) = 6.01 t/s

My biggest regret is not buying more RAM so that I could run models at larger context windows for RAG. 

Any and all feedback or questions are welcome.

\*Notes my screen capturing will not let me use my micrphone, so I am typing, but you can use Whisper alongside everything else.  Also, the audio is crummy because its just the sound from my speakers recorded in the microphone.  If the response from the model is not too long the final TTS reply is almost as fast as talking to a person (see end of video for fast reply).

I've been interested in getting the most out of a single GPU card, the video has everything running on a single 4090.

text-generation-webui-model\_ducking Extension: [https://github.com/BoredBrownBear/text-generation-webui-model\_ducking](https://github.com/BoredBrownBear/text-generation-webui-model_ducking) This is a large part of the solution, it unloads your llm from vram when not inferencing with it, so the SDXL and phivision models can load in their place

SDXL: using the send\_api\_pictures extension that comes with textgen, altered to unload and load the model only when in use (If there is interest I can try documenting this)

Vision Model: [https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid\_Vision](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision) (I made this extension FYSA) This lets you load a variety of different vision models and will auto load and unload them without needing to alter anything.

STT: using the Whisper\_STT extension that comes with textgen, using the small.en model

TTS: using the Alltalk\_tts extension for oobabooga's textgen webui [https://github.com/erew123/alltalk\_tts](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts) I have deepspeed enabled (there are prebuilt wheels for windows that work well), this is why the responses are so quick.

  
The order of loading the extensions is important this is my CMD\_FLAG:

--extensions text-generation-webui-model\_ducking Lucid\_Vision alltalk\_tts whisper\_stt sd\_api\_pictures

If there is interest in this and I'm not beating a dead horse (like this is a common setup) I can document the changes to the code and exactly how I'm pulling this off.

Created a repo with beam search modification. I've not evaluated yet, but from my experience it produce better answers than default sampler in tasks like story generation and sometimes reasoning. Sampler needs X \* num\_beams computational time

Implementation works with KV cache but may be not optimal and transformers inference relatively slow compare with other backends.  
If you know some good datasets to estimate ability producing long answers I would be glad to see

As I and many of you have noticed, P40s have become really expensive. Are there any cards with similar amounts of VRAM that don't cost an arm and a leg?

The ones I know of off the top of my head are:
- P100: 16gb of VRAM, actually usable fp16 perf, but has power state issues and also isn't nearly as usable with llama.cpp as the P40 (Can anyone confirm this, I can't remember where I heard this from)
- 2080ti 22gb: A decent deal for 22gb of vram but still pretty expensive
- M40: 24gb of VRAM but apparently sucks for anything ML related. Could it even potentially be used to get usable speeds or is Maxwell too out of date?

Post Title: 'My experience running the massive WizardLM2 8x22b (141b) on the cheapest current Threadripper CPU + a 4090 + 64Gb DDR5 RDIMM '
                    User: Porespellar
                    Subreddit: r/LocalLLaMA:
                    Text body: TL:DR - I built an inference server / VR gaming PC using the cheapest current Threadripper CPU + RTX 4090 + the fastest DDR5 RAM and M2 drive I could find. Loaded up a huge 141b parameter model that I knew would max it out. Token speed was way better than I expected and is totally tolerable. Biggest regret is not buying more RAM. 

I just finished building a purpose-built home lab inference server and wanted to share my experience and test results with my favorite Reddit community. 

I’ve been futzing around for the past year running AI models on an old VR gaming / mining rig (5yr pld intel i7 + 3070 + 32 GB of DDR4) and yeah, it could run 8b models ok, but other than that, it was pretty bad at running anything else. 

I finally decided to build a proper inference server that will also double as a VR rig because I can’t in good conscience let a 4090 sit in a PC and not game on it at least occasionally. 

I was originally going to go with the Mac Studio with 192GB of RAM route but decided against it because I know as soon as I bought it they would release the M4 model and I would have buyer’s remorse for years to come. 

I also considered doing an AMD EPYC CPU build to get close to the memory bandwidth of the Mac Studio but decided against it because there is literally only one or two ATX EPYC motherboards available because EPYCs are made for servers. I didn’t want a rack mount setup or a mobo that didn’t even have an audio chip or other basic quality of life features. 

So here’s the inference server I ended up building:
- Gigabyte AERO D TRX50 revision 1.2 Motherboard
- AMD 7960X Threadripper CPU
- Noctua NH-U14S TR5-SP6 CPU Cooler
- 64GB Kingston Fury Renegade Pro 6400 DDR5 RDIMMS (4 x 16GB) RAM
- 2 TB Crucial T700 M.2 NVME Gen 5 @ 12,400 Mb/s
- Seasonic TX 1300W Power Supply 
- Gigabyte AERO RTX 4090 GPU
- Fractal Torrent Case (with 2 180mm front fans and 3 140mm bottom fans)

For software and config I’m running:
- Win11 Pro with Ollama and Docker + Open WebUI + Apache Tika (for pre-RAG document parsing). 
- AMD Expo OC @6400 profile for memory speed 
- Resizable BAR feature turned on in BIOS to help with LLM RAM offloading once VRAM fills up
- Nvidia Studio Drivers up-to-date

I knew that the WizardLM2 8x22b (141b) model was a beast and would fill up VRAM, bleed into system RAM, and then likely overflow into M.2 disk storage after its context window was taken into account. I watched it do all of this in resource monitor and HWinfo. 

Amazingly, when I ran a few test prompts on the huge 141 billion parameter WizardLM2 8x22b, I was getting slow (6 tokens per second) but completely coherent and usable responses. I honestly can’t believe that it could run this model AT ALL without crashing the system. 

To test the inference speed of my Threadripper build, I tested a variety of models using Llama-bench. Here are the results. Note: tokens per second in the results are an average from 2 standard Llama-bench prompts (assume Q4 GGUFs unless otherwise stated in the model name)

- llama3: 8b-instruct-Fp16 = 50.49 t/s avg
- llama3: 70b-instruct = 4.72 t/s avg 
- command-r: 35b-v0.1-q4 K M = 18.69 t/s avg
- 1lava: 34b-v1.6-q4 K_M = 35.12 t/s avg 
- gwen2:72b = 4.56 t/s avg
- wizardin2: 8x226 (141b) = 6.01 t/s

My biggest regret is not buying more RAM so that I could run models at larger context windows for RAG. 

Any and all feedback or questions are welcome.

SDXL: using the send\_api\_pictures extension that comes with textgen, altered to unload and load the model only when in use (If there is interest I can try documenting this)

Vision Model: [https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid\_Vision](https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/Lucid_Vision) (I made this extension FYSA) This lets you load a variety of different vision models and will auto load and unload them without needing to alter anything.

STT: using the Whisper\_STT extension that comes with textgen, using the small.en model

TTS: using the Alltalk\_tts extension for oobabooga's textgen webui [https://github.com/erew123/alltalk\_tts](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts) I have deepspeed enabled (there are prebuilt wheels for windows that work well), this is why the responses are so quick.

  
The order of loading the extensions is important this is my CMD\_FLAG:

If there is interest in this and I'm not beating a dead horse (like this is a common setup) I can document the changes to the code and exactly how I'm pulling this off.

This video of a talk given few days ago discusses techniques used to increase CPU inference speed.

Of particular interest to me is the Threadripper speedups mentioned at 10:30 ish

"if you have a threadripper you're going to see better performance than ever, almost like a GPU"

The slide shows a speedup of 300 tok/s --> 2400 tok/s which is if I'm not mistaken, a 700% gain

Granted it's not too meaningful without knowing which model they were testing it on, but still, this is great news, especially together with the intro speaker's position asserting the importance of open source ai

According to him larger models have lot of redundant data like entire sha256 encryption of numbers cause they have memorized the entire internet.

Carefully crafting synthetic data using larger models is the way to go

According to karpathy
This is not very different from Tesla with self-driving networks. What is the "offline tracker" (presented in AI day)? It is a synthetic data generating process, taking the previous, weaker (or e.g. singleframe, or bounding box only) models, running them over clips in an offline 3D+time reconstruction process, and generating cleaner training data, at scale, directly for the 3D multicam video networks. The same has to play out in LLMs.



Key takeaway: LLMs have to become big before they can get smaller.

This video of a talk given few days ago discusses techniques used to increase CPU inference speed.

Of particular interest to me is the Threadripper speedups mentioned at 10:30 ish

"if you have a threadripper you're going to see better performance than ever, almost like a GPU"

The slide shows a speedup of 300 tok/s --> 2400 tok/s which is if I'm not mistaken, a 700% gain

Granted it's not too meaningful without knowing which model they were testing it on, but still, this is great news, especially together with the intro speaker's position asserting the importance of open source ai

According to him larger models have lot of redundant data like entire sha256 encryption of numbers cause they have memorized the entire internet.

Carefully crafting synthetic data using larger models is the way to go

According to karpathy
This is not very different from Tesla with self-driving networks. What is the "offline tracker" (presented in AI day)? It is a synthetic data generating process, taking the previous, weaker (or e.g. singleframe, or bounding box only) models, running them over clips in an offline 3D+time reconstruction process, and generating cleaner training data, at scale, directly for the 3D multicam video networks. The same has to play out in LLMs.



Key takeaway: LLMs have to become big before they can get smaller.

- Qwen2:72b - Smart, professional, and reliable
- Llava:34b - For vision-related tasks. May replace it if they ever release a GGUF for Florence.
- Llama:70b - I use it as a second opinion model after I ask Qwen2 something. 
- Codestral - for code stuff, duh 

LLMs I’m interested in trying:
- Florence (hope it’s better than Llava) 
- Gemma2-27b (because of high ranking on LMSYS)
- ColPali for doc retrieval
- StevenSeagall (if someone ever names an LLM after Bullshido master Steven Seagall, I’ll totally try it)
